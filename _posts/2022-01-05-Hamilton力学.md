# Hamilton力学
Hamiltonian Mechanics is the study of conservative systems of Classical Mechanics.
These systems are modeled by hamiltonian systems. The purpose of this chapter is to
introduce step by step the concept of a hamiltonian system which is a special case of
a dynamical system induced by a function $H$ on phase space.

Since we need general phase spaces this chapter also serves to recall the basic notions
related to a manifold and the notation used throughout the lecture notes.

## 一个简单的Hamilton系统
### 正则方程
We begin with a special case of a system of Hamiltonian Mechanics where the config-
uration space (”Ortsraum”) is an open subset $U\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n} (n\in\mathbb{N}, n>0):$
